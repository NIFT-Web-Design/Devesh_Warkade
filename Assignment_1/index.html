    <h1 class="firstHeader"> Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h1>
    <p class="servicesIntro"> We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>
    <div class="services-container">
        <div class="service-box">
            <div class="service-title">Part-Time Consultants</div>
            <div class="service-desc">
              Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="service-box">
            <div class="service-title">Advice on Retainer</div>
            <div class="service-desc">
              At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="service-box">
            <div class="service-title">Remote Consultants</div>
            <div class="service-desc">
              When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="service-box">
            <div class="service-title">Short-term Contracts</div>
            <div class="service-desc">
              Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="service-box">
            <div class="service-title">Cost-Flexible Solutions</div>

              Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.

              If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a consultant work on a trial-basis.
